### Malware
* [YARA](https://plusvic.github.io/yara/) - YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings and a boolean expression which determine its logic.

It can be used to analyse such malware families as Havex RAT and Win32/Industroyer.
* [FLARE VM](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm) - FLARE VM is a fully customizable, Windows-based security distribution for malware analysis, incident response, penetration testing, etc.

Passively map, and visually display, an ICS/SCADA network topology while safely conducting device discovery, accounting, and reporting on these critical cyber-physical systems. Now Deprecated, so mirrored here.
* ARMORE - ARMORE was developed to be an open-source software solution that will aid asset owners by increasing visibility, securing communications, and inspecting ICS communications for behavior that is not intended. Built around Bro and Linux.

* Flare - An analytical framework for network traffic and behavioral analytics
* Skydive - An open source real-time network topology and protocols analyzer
* Zeek Goose Protocol Parser - A Zeek GOOSE parser has been developed to enable detailed analysis of the transmitted data and allow rule-based identification of anomalies related to cybersecurity attacks. It is compatible with an older instance of Zeek Network Security Monitor (v2.6).
* ntopng (community version) - a web-based network traffic monitoring application released under GPLv3. Supports Industrial IOT and Scada with modbus, DNP3 and IEC 60870-5-104 since ntopng 4.2 (October 2020)
* Sequence 2 Sequence Anomaly Detection on SWaT - Anomaly Detection for SWaT Dataset using Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Networks
* Poisoning ICS Attack Detectors - Poisoning Attacks on Cyber Attack Detectors for Industrial Control Systems -- operates on the SWaT dataset
* [OpalOPC](https://opalopc.com/) - An OPC UA vulnerability and misconfiguration scanner
